Hi. I am Lys, but most people know me as Aotra online. I make cool projects that play nicely with the internet and I work with languages like Python, C#, JavaScript and HTML and CSS. Also somewhat experienced with Git as well as Node.js and AWS Services.

I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I like to think I know my way around a codebase. I'm constantly looking for ways to improve and expand my skillset. If you want someone to help you build something cool, or just want to chat about literally anything, feel free to contact me through my website <3
