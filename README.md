im evelyn. I like making cool projects that interact with the internet and I work with languages like Python, Java, GDScript, JavaScript, HTML + CSS and c++

I currently just make cool personal projects but I'm constantly looking for ways to improve and expand my skillset so if you want someone to help you build something cool, or just want to chat about literally anything, feel free to contact me through discord or smoke signals (whichever is most convenient) <3
